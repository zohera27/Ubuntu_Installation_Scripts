To change the screen resolution in Ubuntu running on Hyper-V, you can follow these steps:

Launch Ubuntu in Hyper-V.

Open a terminal window by pressing the "Ctrl+Alt+T" keyboard shortcut.

Type the following command to open the Xorg configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Add the following lines to the file:

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Default Screen"
    SubSection "Display"
        Depth 24
        Modes "1920x1080"
    EndSubSection

Note: The "1920x1080" resolution is just an example. You can replace it with any resolution that is supported by your monitor.

Save and exit the file by pressing "Ctrl+X", then "Y", and then "Enter".
