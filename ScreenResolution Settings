Since you are running Ubuntu 22.04.2 as a virtual machine using Hyper-V, you may need to install the virtual drivers to get the best performance and resolution. You can follow the steps below to install the Hyper-V Integration Services on Ubuntu:

Start the Ubuntu virtual machine.

Open the Terminal application.

Install the Hyper-V integration services by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

sudo apt-get install hv-kvp-daemon-init linux-tools-virtual linux-cloud-tools-virtual

Reboot the virtual machine by typing the following command and pressing Enter

sudo reboot

After the virtual machine reboots, the Hyper-V integration services should be installed and the virtual machine should have better performance and screen resolution.

If the performance is still not satisfactory, you may need to install additional drivers for your laptop's hardware. You can check the ASUS website for drivers and support for Ubuntu, or try installing the drivers manually.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
