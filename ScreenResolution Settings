sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-virtual

To change the screen resolution in Ubuntu running on Hyper-V, you can follow these steps:

Open the GRUB configuration file using a text editor:

sudo nano /etc/default/grub

Find the following line in the file:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

Modify the line to add "video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080" (or the screen resolution of your choice) to the end, like this:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080"

Note: Make sure to replace "1920x1080" with the screen resolution you want to use.

Save the file by pressing "Ctrl+X", then "Y", and then "Enter".

Update the GRUB configuration by running the following command:

sudo update-grub

Reboot your Ubuntu virtual machine again by running the following command:
sudo reboot
