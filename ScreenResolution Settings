Since you are running Ubuntu 22.04.2 as a virtual machine using Hyper-V, you may need to install the virtual drivers to get the best performance and resolution. 
You can follow the steps below to install the Hyper-V Integration Services on Ubuntu:

Open the Terminal application on your Ubuntu virtual machine.
Add the Microsoft package repository key by running the following command:

wget https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF

Add the Microsoft package repository to your sources list by running the following command:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-focal-prod focal main"
Update your package list:
sudo apt-get update

Install the Hyper-V integration services by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

sudo apt-get install hv-kvp-daemon-init linux-tools-virtual linux-cloud-tools-virtual

Reboot the virtual machine by typing the following command and pressing Enter

sudo reboot

After the virtual machine reboots, the Hyper-V integration services should be installed and the virtual machine should have better performance and screen resolution.

If the performance is still not satisfactory, you may need to install additional drivers for your laptop's hardware. You can check the ASUS website for drivers and support for Ubuntu, or try installing the drivers manually.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-all

sudo apt-get install linux-generic

sudo apt-get install linux-azure
for LTS :::: sudo apt-get install linux-tools-5.19.0-40-generic linux-cloud-tools-5.19.0-40-generic
sudo systemctl start hv_vss_daemon.service hv_fcopy_daemon.service hv_kvp_daemon.service
linux-tools-5.19.0-40-generic
linux-cloud-tools-5.19.0-40-generic
linux-tools-generic
linux-cloud-tools-generic

sudo systemctl status hv*
hv-vss-daemon.service
hv-fcopy-daemon.service
hv-kvp-daemon.service

sudo update-initramfs -u

Reboot the virtual machine.
cat /proc/asound/cards
This should display a list of available sound cards. Look for the card that is labeled "ALSA" and note its number (usually 0).

Open the sound settings by clicking on the speaker icon in the top right corner of the screen, then click on "Sound Settings". 
Under the "Output" tab, select the ALSA sound card from the list (it should be labeled with the number you noted in the previous step).

If you still have issues with the sound, you can try adjusting the ALSA mixer settings by running the following command in the terminal:

alsamixer

sudo nano /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080"
GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768,800x600,640x480
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
